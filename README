Pong Game

The classic retro Pong game recreated using Python.

This project is from the bootcamp course 100 Days of Python Code, created by the App Brewery.

Description:
This is a recreation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics module. The game features two paddles and a ball. Players control the paddles to bounce the ball back and forth. The game keeps score and gets progressively faster as the ball hits the paddles.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ping-pong-game.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd ping-pong-game

Game Controls:
- Right Paddle: Move up with the "Up" arrow key, move down with the "Down" arrow key.
- Left Paddle: Move up with the "W" key, move down with the "S" key.

Key Features:
- Paddle Class: Controls the movement of the paddles.
- Ball Class: Handles the ball's movement and bouncing logic, with the ball speeding up each time it hits a paddle.
- Scoreboard Class: Keeps track of and displays the score.

Known Issues & Future Improvements:
- Error Handling: There's an error where the ball sometimes bounces inside the paddle when it hits the side.
- Code Comments: Adding more detailed comments, especially docstrings for methods, to improve code readability and usability.
- Sound Effects: Adding sound effects for paddle hits and scoring.
- Difficulty Levels: Implementing different difficulty levels.
- Power-ups: Introducing power-ups to make the game more dynamic.
